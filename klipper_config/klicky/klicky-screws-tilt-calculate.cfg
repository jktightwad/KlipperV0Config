# This macro was provided by discord user Garrettwp to whom i give my thanks for sharing it with me.
# I have tweaked it a lot.
#
# this macro is  based on the great Annex magprobe dockable probe macros "#Originally developed by Mental, modified for better use on K-series printers by RyanG and Trails"
# that macro as since evolved into a klipper plugin that currently is pending inclusion in klipper
# more information here https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Quickdraw_Probe/tree/main/Klipper_Macros
#
# by standing on the shoulders of giants, lets see if we can see further
# User richardjm revised the macro variables and added some functions, thanks a lot
